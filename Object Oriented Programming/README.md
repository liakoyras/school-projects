# Object Oriented Programming
The C++ projects I did for my 3rd semester Object Oriented Programming course.

More specifically:

## Project 1 (Structs-Functions)
We need to create a struct representing a Samurai and implement the following functions:
- A function that shows for what tasks is the Samurai suitable, depending on their sex and whether they are a Ninja or not
- A functions that sets the experience of the Samurai based on the number of completed tasks
- A function that shows if the Samurai is experienced or not (based on an attribute)

## Project 2 (Classes basics)
We need to create a class representing a Samurai and implement the following functions:
- A constructor and destructor
- Getters and setters for Samurai attributes
- A function that prints the description of a Samurai
- A mock dueling function that updates the attributes of each Samurai object that took part in the duel

## Project 3 (Object interactions)
We need to improve on the previous project by adding the following:
- A new class representing a weapon (along with constructor, destructor)
- Getters and setters for all new attributes
- A function that assigns a weapon to a Samurai, depending on their age
- A function for duels with young Samurai
- A function for duels with adult Samurai, implementing rock-paper-scissors

## Project 4 (Inheritance-Operator overloading-Call by reference/value)
We need to improve on the previous project by adding the following:
- New classes for exotic weapons and Ninja (inheriting weapons and Samurai respectively)
- A function that allows only Ninja to pick an exotic weapon
- A new class representing a Ninja school (an array of Ninja)
- A function that trains a Samurai into a Ninja
- A function that allows only adult Ninja into a Ninja class
- A function that compares the grade of all Ninja in a class to find the one with the bigger grade


All of the projects contain some sample main function that tests the classes and functions. Sometimes, Windows commands (like `system("pause")`) are used.
