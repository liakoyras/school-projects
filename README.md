# school-projects
This is a repository that contains many of the code projects I worked on for university courses. This README also links to external repositories for school projects that I have worked on.

## Index
The courses are listed in chronological order, with newer projects closer to the top.<br>
You can find more information on each project's individual README.

### Databases
This is a group project in which we created a database that models the employees, patients and supplies of a healthcare company that manages a number of clinics. We also built a website that demonstrates some of the functionality that database supports.<br>

### Microprocessors
This is simple Assembly program for the ARM Cortex-M0+ processor that does an arithmetic operation based on the operation the user specifies and encodes the result to be displayed in 7-segment displays.<br>

### Integrated Circuits
This contains a multitude of System Verilog Projects I did for the Integrated Circuits course and labs, covering topics like design and verification.<br>

### Software Engineering (Unispace)
This is a project that the whole of the class worked on for the duration of the course. It is a web-based university management software, for use by students, faculty and administrators.<br>
It supports enrollment, grade books, a messaging service and overall curriculum management.<br>
I was a part of the back end development team.<br>

### Sound Engineering
This is a collection of group projects. We used MATLAB in order to implement different sound engineering techniques, including de-essing, voice activity detection, compression and decompression, voice generation and a variety of sound effect filters (like chorus and reverb).<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Sound Engineering>)

### Web Programming
This is a project I worked on for the Web Programming course. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to create a web-app where the user can view and manage contacts.<br>
