# VLSI Systems
The System Verilog projects I did for my 8th semester VLSI Systems course and labs.

More specifically:

## Lab 1 (VGA screen rendering)
We need to design:
- A circuit that will be able to "draw" four differently colored squares on the center of a screen that uses a VGA interface, at a frame rate of 60 fps.
