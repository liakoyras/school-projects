# High Level Synthesis
The projects I did for my 9th semester High Level Synthesis course.<br>
The code is in C++ that can be used to create synthesizable HDL via software tools.

## Lab 2
A simple module that can execute the binary search algorithm, along with a simple testbench.

## Project 2
Simple programs and testbenches with the following functionality:
- `checksum.cpp`: Calculate the checksum of an unsigned integer, doubling digits in odd-numbered positions and if the result is greater than 9, add both digits to the sum 
- `count_ones.cpp`: Calculate the number bits that are equal to '1' for an unsigned 32-bit integer
- `row_sum.cpp`: Calculate the sum of each row of a 2D array
- `wave_sort.cpp`: Sort an array in wave form (so that `arr[0]>=arr[1]<=arr[2]>=arr[3]...` 

## Project 4
A module that can perform a single step of the K-Means clustering algorithm, along with some Python code and data for verification.
